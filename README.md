# C# Variant data type

A class that mimics the behavior of the so-called variant data type.

The Variant class can be transparently assigned and converted to/from any basic data type (string, datetime, sbyte, byte, short, int, long, ushort, uint, ulong, float, double, bool, char, decimal as well as their nullable types).

See the file [test.cs](test.cs) to view the possibilities.
